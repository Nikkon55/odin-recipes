<h1>Haitian Fried Chicken</h1>
<img src="../img/chicken.jpeg" alt="picture of fried chicken leg">
<p>This Haitian fried chicken is unique because it doesn't have a traditional crunchy outer breading. Lack of breading doesn't mean lack of flavor — the acid from the lemon juice tenderizes the drumsticks and there are lots of flavors bursting through. Give yourself plenty of time to allow the marinade to soak into the chicken so that the flavors are in every bite.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3 pounds chicken legs</li>
    <li>1 cup lemon juice</li>
